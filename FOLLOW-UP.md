### Follow Up Questions:

1. What libraries did you use? Why did you use them?

```Answer : 
 * @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap : I use this package as it has a lot of components including pagination, and another reason is with this package i have an access to bootstrap classes, which can make my work easy and clean.
 ```

2. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

```
 * I will improve the api request, also will implement caching so that we can minimize and avoid calling the same endpoints

 * If had more access to the crossref data and its content, I will implement a download button so that all users can download it.
```

3. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

```
 * Let's say I'm proud of this project but I mostly proud on how I planned and execute it from the scratch. the crossref API is the basis of my components architecture and project structure as well.
```


4. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

```
 * Reading and Understanding the Crossref API, since the response data/object structure is pretty dynamic so I need to dig more on the documentation.
```
